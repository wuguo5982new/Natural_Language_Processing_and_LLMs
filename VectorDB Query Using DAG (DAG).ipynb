Dr. David M. Nath an is Direc tor of the Diabetes Center and C linical Resea rch Center at Massachusett s Gener al Hospital and a \\nProfessor of Medicine at Harvard Me dical Scho ol, Bo ston, M A.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe classification of diabetes was originally limited to only two categories called juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, now known as type 1 \\ndiabetes mellitus, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus, now known as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This has grown to a recognition of more \\nthan 50 subcategories caused by various pathogenic mechanisms or accompanying other diseases and syndromes. The diagnosis of \\ndiabetes has evolved from physician recognition of typical symptoms to detection of ambient hyperglycemia and, thence, to the defi -\\nnition of excessive plasma glucose levels after an overnight fast and/or following challenge with a glucose load (oral glucose tolerance \\ntest or OGTT), and more recently, by measurement of glycated hemoglobin (A1c). Screening has uncovered a much higher prevalence \\nof diabetes in the United States and elsewhere, as well as its enormous public health impact. Modern testing has defined individuals at \\nhigh risk for the development of diabetes and pregnant women whose fetuses are at increased risk for mortality and morbidity.\\nType 1 diabetes results from an autoimmune attack on the pancreatic islet beta cells, manifest by autoantibodies and T cells reactive \\nwith islet cell antigens prior to and after the development of hyperglycemia. When approximately 80% of beta cells have been damaged \\nor destroyed, insulin deficiency produces hyperglycemia and risk of ketosis. Hyperglycemia, in turn, causes osmotic diuresis resulting \\nin frequent urination, thirst, and weight loss. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of insulin resistance and relative insulin \\ninsufficiency. Insulin resistance accompanies obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and advanced age. The pathogenetic factors of type 1 \\nand type 2 diabetes overlap in many patients, with obesity now prevalent in children and adults. Gestational diabetes is specific for \\npregnancy and is a harbinger of future type 2 diabetes.\\nDiagnostic glycemic criteria for presymptomatic diabetes have been set using diabetic retinopathy as a specific complication of the \\ndisease: A1c ≥6.5%; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL; or plasma glucose measured 2 hours after an OGTT (2-hour PG) ≥200 \\nmg/dL. For patients with typical symptoms, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL is diagnostic. The 2-hour PG yields the highest prevalence and A1c the lowest. A1c is the most convenient and practical test, requiring no preparation, is analytically superior, and has \\nthe lowest intraindividual variation. It is more expensive than the FPG, but the same or less than the OGTT. The 2-hour PG is the most \\nburdensome to the patient and has the highest intraindividual variation. Standardized measurement of A1c is not available everywhere. \\nConfirmation of an abnormal test with the same test is recommended. \\nStudies in various populations show inconsistency among the glycemic tests. Of people meeting the A1c criterion, 27%–98% meet \\nplasma glucose criteria. Of people meeting plasma glucose criteria, 17%–78% meet the A1c criterion. These discrepancies occur \\nbecause each test measures different aspects of hyperglycemia that may vary among patients. While the risk of future diabetes is \\ncontinuously associated with plasma glucose and A1c, the areas between the upper limits of normal and the diabetes cutpoints have \\nbeen called “prediabetes” or “high risk for diabetes.” These have been defined categorically as A1c 6.0%–6.4% or 5.7%–6.4%; impaired \\nfasting glucose (IFG), FPG 100–125 mg/dL; and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 2-hour PG 140–199 mg/dL. A1c 6.0%–6.4% increases \\nthe odds ratio (OR) for progression to diabetes (OR 12.5–16) more than the range of 5.7%–6.4% (OR 9.2).\\nIn U.S. studies, the incidence of type 2 diabetes averages approximately 6% per year in people with IGT and can reverse spontaneously. IFG is more prevalent than IGT in the United States, though IGT rises more sharply with age. IFG increases the risk of future diabetes to \\nvarious degrees in different countries, with odds ratios ranging from 2.9 to 18.5.\\nOpportunistic screening for diabetes in health care venues, especially if targeted to persons with high-risk characteristics, e.g., obesity \\nand older age, can be cost-effective.

      "[Document(page_content='Classification and Diagnosis of Diabetes\\n1–3diagnosed during pregnancy. Secondary \\nor other specific types of diabetes encom -\\npass a large spectrum of specific causes, including monogenic defects of beta cell \\nfunction, genetic defects in insulin action \\nor structure, pancreatic diseases such as \\npancreatitis and hemochromatosis, endo -\\ncrinopathies, drug/chemical and surgically \\ninduced, infections, and uncommon immune-mediated and other genetic \\nsyndromes sometimes associated with \\ndiabetes. Detailed discussions of each \\ntype of diabetes are provided in Section I \\nSpectrum of Diabetes, Chapters 2–7.\\nTYPE 1 DIABETES\\nType 1 diabetes represents approximately \\n5% of all diabetes ( 1). Central to the \\npathophysiology of most cases of type 1 \\ndiabetes is an autoimmune attack on the \\npancreatic beta cells resulting in severe insulin deficiency. Although the beta cell \\ndamage and death are primarily T cell-\\nmediated, B cell-formed autoantibodies \\nto islet antigens are used as markers of the disease and may play a pathogenic \\nrole. Research studies frequently require positivity for one or more of these \\nautoantibodies for the diagnosis of type 1 \\ndiabetes. There also may be nonimmune-\\nmediated causes of beta cell damage and \\ndestruction and, especially in Asians, a disease called fulminant diabetes has \\nbeen described ( 7). \\nAt the time of diagnosis, type 1 diabetes \\npatients are typically of peripubertal \\nage, Caucasian, lean, and with a short \\nduration of symptoms, such as polyuria, \\npolydipsia, and weight loss. A family \\nhistory of type 1 diabetes is often \\nabsent, although a family history of other autoimmune disease, such as Grave’s \\ndisease or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, may be \\npresent. No single clinical characteristic, \\nsuch as age at diagnosis, body mass, or \\neven ketoacidosis, is sufficiently sensitive \\nand specific for type 1 diabetes to be \\nvery useful in distinguishing one form of \\ndiabetes from another. For example, with \\nthe increasing epidemic of childhood and \\nadolescent obesity, children with type \\n1 diabetes reflect the usual distribution \\nof weight in their age group. In type 1 diabetes prevention and natural history studies in which subjects at high risk for \\ntype 1 diabetes are followed very closely, \\nover 50% of cases are diagnosed with \\nhyperglycemia that is asymptomatic since \\nthe glucose levels are not high enough to \\ncause symptoms, such as polyuria and \\nweight loss ( 8,9). This is very different \\nthan the seemingly abrupt onset of \\nsymptoms when people are diagnosed in \\nthe clinical setting. \\nAlthough severe insulin deficiency is a \\ncentral element of type 1 diabetes, it may \\nnot discriminate between type 1 diabetes, \\nespecially early in its course, and type \\n2 diabetes, especially late in its course. \\nInsulin and C-peptide levels may not be \\nseverely low early in the type 1 disease \\nprocess and during the “honeymoon period,” a time shortly after diabetes \\ndiagnosis when diabetes appears to go \\naway for a period of a few months to a year. Conversely, some patients with \\ntype 2 diabetes may have severe insulin \\ndeficiency with very low insulin and \\nC-peptide levels later in its course that \\noverlap the levels in type 1 diabetes. The \\nbest laboratory tests to differentiate type 1 \\nfrom type 2 diabetes are autoantibodies to \\nglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), insulin, \\ninsulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2), and \\nzinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), especially when \\npatients are positive for more than one \\nand have relatively high titers. \\nType 1 diabetes is heterogeneous in a \\nnumber of respects. Although several \\ngenes predisposing to and protecting \\nfrom type 1 diabetes are well described, \\ngenotypes of individual patients span \\na large spectrum. Many environmental \\nfactors may trigger and/or influence the \\nseverity of the autoimmune attack on \\nthe beta cells, and the specific immune \\nmechanisms operative in individual patients appear to be variable. At \\ndiagnosis, patients span the spectrum \\nfrom severe insulin deficiency with \\nmarked hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis \\nto asymptomatic, mild postprandial \\nhyperglycemia. The rate of decline in beta cell function prior to and after \\ndiagnosis of type 1 diabetes is also extremely variable. In Caucasians with \\ntype 1 diabetes, endogenous beta cell function declines over months to years \\nwith the decline being slower in patients who develop diabetes at an older age \\n(10). More sensitive assays for C-peptide \\nhave detected measureable levels after \\nmany years of type 1 diabetes ( 11,12,13). \\nCirculating C-peptide has even been \\ndescribed in Joslin Medalists who have \\nhad type 1 diabetes for more than 50 \\nyears ( 14). Over their lifetimes with type \\n1 diabetes, the frequency of end-organ \\ncomplications, although definitely affected \\nby glycemic control, is still extremely \\nvariable among patients. \\nThe ADA recognizes two forms of type 1 \\ndiabetes, type 1a and type 1b diabetes \\n(6). If antibodies are present along with \\ninsulinopenia and ketosis, a diagnosis \\nof autoimmune type 1 diabetes or type \\n1a diabetes may be given. If individuals \\nhave a clinical picture consistent with \\ntype 1 diabetes, but no antibodies are \\npresent, the ADA recognizes a category \\nlabeled type 1b diabetes (or idiopathic \\ntype 1 diabetes). These latter patients may \\nhave a different underlying pathology of \\ndisease, or they may have autoantibodies \\nthat are not measured by common assays. \\nThe use of the term “type 1 diabetes” in \\nDiabetes in America, 3rd edition,  refers \\nto the autoimmune form (type 1a) unless \\notherwise specified.\\nTYPE 2 DIABETES\\nType 2 diabetes is the other major type \\nof diabetes and comprises 90%–95% of \\nthe total cases of diabetes in the United \\nStates and worldwide ( 1). It is caused \\nby the combination of insulin resistance, \\nlargely due to obesity, and deficient \\ninsulin secretion, which appears to be \\nthe rate-limiting step in type 2 diabetes \\npathogenesis. Insulin secretion is insuffi -\\ncient given the degree of insulin resistance \\nand is termed relative insulin deficiency. \\nThe cause of the insulin secretory defect \\nis probably multifactorial but is usually \\nconsidered to be metabolic and not auto -\\nimmune. Studies of the development of \\ntype 2 diabetes in Native American Pima \\nIndians show marked, progressive loss of \\ninsulin secretion with progression from normal to impaired glucose tolerance \\n(IGT) to diabetes (Figure 1.1) ( 15).
